One of the most frustrating things I've found during my time studying journalism is the established media's preoccupation with narrative and structure. While this makes sense as a means of conveying information in an accessible, entertaining way, the classic narrative structure which informs so much of our news process often fails to provide adequate perspective to its audience. Meanwhile, the inverted pyramid, which most journalists use as a formula to structure news stories, is frustratingly simplistic.

*This does not an interesting narrative structure and it isn't a sophisticated way of presenting facts and - all in all - it makes me sad.*

I've found that history, on the other hand, is often focused on painting a picture, rather than telling a story. I was drawn to journalism primarily because of an interest in inquiring, discovering, interpreting, and communicating facts and perspectives about the world around us. Over the past four years I've found history to be a much more sophisticated, interesting means of doing that, while I saw journalism as being far too preoccupied with simplistic story-telling [(and pictures of hedgehogs.)](http://www.buzzfeed.com/babymantis/15-hedgehogs-with-things-that-look-like-hedgehogs-1opu) This is what drew me to history, and is what I find particularly interesting about data mining. I enjoy the process of examining raw data and extracting information about the world from that.

In short, everything that appealed to me about journalism can be found in history, only in a more sophisticated, meaningful context. Finding trends, and understanding historical context, makes a story that much more useful.

My digital skills, however, peak somewhere around Minesweeper. I've been lucky enough to have some experience with data journalism, during which I was introduced to a handful of basic tools for data visualization, particularly for [constructing interactive maps.](www.batchgeo.com) Other than that, I've used InDesign for the layout of [Centretown News.](http://www.centretownnews.ca).

I'm hoping this class will help provide some of the tools, both analytical and technical, to examine, interpret, process, and communicate data in a meaningful way. If I can accomplish that, I think it will make for a useful asset in any situation.
